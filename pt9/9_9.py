9.9 Project: Course Registry

Program Description: This program implements a data structure containing information about the courses offered by a university. The program should help a student to select suitable courses to enroll.

Author note: the docstring auto-generated by VSC is different than that of PyCharm
I hope you, the TA checking this, won't mind ^^
